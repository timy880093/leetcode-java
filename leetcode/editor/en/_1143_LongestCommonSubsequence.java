/**
 * Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence. If
 * there is no common subsequence, return 0.
 *
 * <p>A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some
 * characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.
 *
 * <p>For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".
 *
 * <p>A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.
 *
 * <p>Example 1:
 *
 * <p>Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace" Output: 3 Explanation: The longest common subsequence is
 * "ace" and its length is 3.
 *
 * <p>Example 2:
 *
 * <p>Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc" Output: 3 Explanation: The longest common subsequence is
 * "abc" and its length is 3.
 *
 * <p>Example 3:
 *
 * <p>Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "def" Output: 0 Explanation: There is no such common
 * subsequence, so the result is 0.
 *
 * <p>Constraints:
 *
 * <p>1 <= text1.length, text2.length <= 1000 text1 and text2 consist of only lowercase English
 * characters.
